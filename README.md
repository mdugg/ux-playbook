# ux-playbook
Ever expanding collection of resources relating to Product Design and UX that I deem part of my toolkit and professional playbook

I'm not looking to collaborate on this project, this is purely a sandbox for me testing ideas, exploring Javascript algorithms

The resources and notes are in JSON format, feel free to grab and re-purpose
